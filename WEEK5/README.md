# âœ… Week 5: Antialiasing, Materials & Realistic Rendering in SYCL

---

## âœ… Goals for Week 5

1. **Complete Chapters 7â€“11.5** of _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_.
2. **Implement advanced features** like antialiasing, diffuse and reflective materials, and dielectrics.
3. **Extend the SYCL-based renderer** with pixel sampling and material tracing (for those on GPU track).

### 2. âš¡ SYCL GPU Extension (Optional for GPU Track)

#### ðŸ“š Reference: [Codeplay Part 2 â€“ Pixel Sampling & Material Tracing](https://www.codeplay.com/portal/blogs/2020/06/19/ray-tracing-in-a-weekend-with-sycl-part-2-pixel-sampling-and-material-tracing.html)

> If you have already ported the basic sphere renderer to SYCL (Week 3), extend it with the following features:

#### ðŸ”§ Tasks

- Implement **multiple-sample antialiasing** in SYCL kernels.
- Add **diffuse reflection** and **Lambertian scatter** to the SYCL scene.
- Implement **metallic** and **dielectric** materials in SYCL using appropriate material structs and scatter logic.
- Apply **gamma correction** and output `.ppm` image from the GPU.

## âœ… Deliverables

- [ ] Ray tracer with antialiasing and materials (CPU)
- [ ] (Optional) Extended SYCL renderer with sampling and materials
- [ ] Generated `.ppm` output images
- [ ] (Optional) Side-by-side comparison of CPU vs GPU renders
