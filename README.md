# SOC'25 â€“ GPU-Based Ray Tracer

Welcome! This repository contains the weekly tasks and learning material for the GPU-Based Ray Tracer project under Summer of Code 2025.
This project is aimed at helping you explore and build a basic ray tracer while learning essential concepts in computer graphics, C++.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Weekly Plan

Each week, new tasks will be released in separate folders (`WEEK2`, `WEEK3`, etc.), building upon the previous work to progressively construct a functional ray tracer.

- Weekly goals will include both coding tasks and math/graphics concepts.
- Be sure to complete each week before the next begins, as future modules will depend on this foundation.

## ðŸ“… Week 1

We begin with foundational work: implementing a `Vec3` class and understanding the vector math that underpins ray tracing.
